<h1>My Journey to Web Design!</h1>
<img src="me.jpg" width="500px" class="center">

<paragraph>Hello everyone! My name is May Zhen and I would like to welcome you to my website. I will be using this as a way to reflect on what I have learned throughout this semester in Web Design. Starting this class, I had no prior knowledge on how to code so this has been a completely new experience for me. Wordpress and Squarespace were two platforms that are great for creating portfolios, blogs, and easy commercial websites. I have used similar platforms in the past for projects so this wasn't as challenging for me. The real challenge has been learning HTML and CSS because there is so much we can do through coding.</paragraph>
<br>
<br>
<paragraph>I would love for this final project to reflect my abilities. I have put a lot of effort into making it exactly how I envision, and I want anyone who sees it to recognize that. This is my final project before I enter the world with a Media Arts: Broadcast, Television, and Digital Media degree, and I feel like this class was a great way to solidify my college career. Putting my coding skills on my resume in the future will be one of my distinguishing factors from other potential hires.</paragraph>

<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the <br> printing and typesetting industry. <br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a <br>galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
