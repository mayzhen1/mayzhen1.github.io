        <h1>HTML and CSS</h1>
        <paragraph>Reflecting on the semester, using HTML and CSS was the most challenging experience for me. The assignments were fairly self-explanatory so this wasn't part of the challenges I was facing. I was responsible for figuring out how to create the different HTML pages in assignment 2 on my own, as I was absent from class. It was easy to figure out once I got the hang of it, but it was definitely a learning experience. The CSS section of the class was more interesting to me. I've always liked being able to customize things and make them look aesthetically pleasing, so this was a great assignment to do. Finishing this class, my main takeaway would be how useful the internet can be for us. It is such a huge asset and using it to find code is the easiest way to complete tasks.<br> <br>Other than the internet, one helpful resource that we had throughout the semester was <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp.</a> This was a great way for me to learn how to use code but with the help of other people. If I didn't quite understand what was happening, there were other people available that are learning the exact same way I am. I enjoyed the setup of the website and how it felt more like a game than anything. It reminded me of playing <a href="https://www.coolmathgames.com">Cool Math Games</a> when I was in elementary school. This is probably why I looked forward to completing a section on Free Code Camp.</a></paragraph>

    <paragraph>Overall, this class has been useful to take as a Media Arts student. Learning how to create my own webpage using HTML and CSS is a skill I hope to continue gaining. It hasn't always been the easiest, but it's a practical skill that I am interested in learning more about!</paragraph>
